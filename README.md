## Overview

Once the most loyal segment of Baltimore City, African American residents are leading the migration out. While they still make up the majority of the population at 57% of all residents, they are also moving out the fastest.

The city has lost more Black residents than white residents with about 57,000 Black residents leaving between 2010 and 2020, according to a Baltimore Banner analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. That was more than double the drop in white residents. Growth in the Hispanic, Asian and multiracial populations offset losses in the Black and Wwhite population.

Black residents said they are leaving the city because of too few job opportunities and investments in majority-Black neighborhoods, while white neighborhoods like such as Canton and Harbor Point have enjoyed new apartment buildings, retail centers, offices and growing populations. Black residents said they have found a better quality of life in neighboring counties, or other states, where they are also finding that they can pay less for the same, if not better, amenities. People also said they left because of persistent crime and better educational opportunities.

## Methodology
### How we analyzed Census data by city neighborhoods

This analysis of the U.S. 2020 Decennial Census was created using Big Local News Census 2020 Co-op version. This [version of the data](https://biglocalnews.org/content/collaborations/census-data-cooperative.html) include calculations created by the Associated Press. It has already accounted for moving tracts.

Crosswalks between [city neighborhoods](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/f63445d9528349febb81f0b89cd8be5b_0/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C0.65) and [Baltimore Metropolitan Council Regional Planning Districts](https://gisdata.baltometro.org/datasets/BMC::2020-regional-planning-districts-rpd/explore?location=39.208664%2C-76.524750%2C9.49) were made in the SF library. Water was removed using the Tigris library. Intersections were calculated as a share of Census tract. Values for the tract were multiplied by the share. Numbers counting people were rounded to the nearest whole.

Race always refers to non-Hispanic populations of any age. Change was calculated raw and as a percentage change. Statements about citywide and countywide trends used the original data. Calculations using neighborhood data would be slightly inaccurate, though less than %1 off.

### Notes from the viz

This crosssection of Baltimore city nieghborhoods and county regional planning districts was made to fit on a mobile device. Regional planning districts are much larger than city neighborhoods. They were used to provide names for places readers would know.
